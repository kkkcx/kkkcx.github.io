I received my M.E. degree from the School of Artificial Intelligence, Beihang University in 2025, under the guidance of Prof. [Xingxing Wei](https://sites.google.com/site/xingxingwei1988/) ([ROSE Vision Lab](https://rose-vision.github.io/)), and was a <u>visiting student</u> at Tsinghua University ([TSAIL](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/)), advised by <a href="https://www.suhangss.me/"> Prof. Hang Su </a> and <a href="https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~yinpeng/"> A/Prof. Yinpeng Dong</a>.
Previously, I received my B.E. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Sichuan University in 2022.

Currently, my research centers on vision-language models for human activity understanding and embodied AI. I have also worked on topics such as autonomous driving, trustworthy AI, and generative models.
