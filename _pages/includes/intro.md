Hi, I am a Ph.D. student at [Sato Lab](https://www.ut-vision.org/), the University of Tokyo, supervised by Prof. [Yoichi Sato](https://sites.google.com/ut-vision.org/ysato/). I received my M.E. degree from the School of Artificial Intelligence, Beihang University in 2025, under the guidance of Prof. [Xingxing Wei](https://sites.google.com/site/xingxingwei1988/) ([ROSE Vision Lab](https://rose-vision.github.io/)), and was a visiting student at Tsinghua University ([TSAIL](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/)), advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.suhangss.me/"> Hang Su </a> and A/Prof. <a href="https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~yinpeng/"> Yinpeng Dong</a>.
Previously, I received my B.E. degree from the School of Computer Science at Sichuan University in 2022.

Currently, my research centers on vision-language models for human activity understanding and embodied AI. I have also worked on topics such as autonomous driving, trustworthy AI, and generative models.
